# Renga prototype
This was a prototype we built for a client in Objective-C.  The client never ended up making the app.

## On code quality
The code in this prototype was never intended for production. This code is meant to be thrown away.  It simply marks out a happy path in which we could UX/UI test very quickly.    

I can write such a prototype in a matter of hours usually.
